# Simplified (very) epidemic simulation

To run you need `python 3.7+`. In parent directory (to this repo) run:
```bash
pip3 install -r epidemic/requirements.txt && python3 -m epidemic
```
Then you should see in the console results of the particular phases and also
`results.png` file should occur which is a graph visualising simulation.
